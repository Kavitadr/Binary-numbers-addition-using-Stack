# Binary-numbers-addition-using-Stack
Application of Stack
Stack follows LIFO principle (Last In First Out).

In this application we directly use Stack as header file as a 
            #include<stack> 
    
but if we can write a separate code to handle all task perform by stack like 
1)push: store /onsert data in stack
2)pop: remove the data from stack 
3)isempty: check stack is empty or not (top==-1)
4)isfull: check stack is full or not 
5)topmostelements: its return top most element on the stack

This application is done binary numbers addition using stack operation, for this we required 3 stack  one for first binary number,
second for second binary number and third one for storing a result.
Its very easy to perform opeartions on binary numbers like addition ,sunstraction etc with the help of stack.
 eg.
 addition of 2 binary number (having same or different length)
 binary no1: 101
 binary no2: 10
 
Addition: 111
